Loaded and Structured Data – Imported a dataset of Netflix titles and created detailed textual representations for each entry, including attributes like title, genre, cast, and description.

Generated Text Embeddings – Processed the textual data using an embedding API, converting each movie's description into a numerical vector for similarity analysis.

Indexed Embeddings for Efficient Search – Created a high-dimensional FAISS index to store and quickly retrieve similar movie embeddings based on user preferences.

Implemented Movie Recommendation – Developed a function to find and display the top movie recommendations by comparing the user’s selected movie against the indexed dataset.

Tested and Displayed Recommendations – Successfully retrieved and displayed a ranked list of movies similar to the user’s chosen film, validating the recommendation system’s functionality.

These points encapsulate the main tasks completed in developing and testing the movie recommendation system.
